/**

 * <p>Roles and assignments live in CSS, but the audit stays in FAM's own tables -
 * CSS keeps no history of who granted what to whom, so if this is not recorded
 * here it is not recorded anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Records are append-only and capture a <em>snapshot</em> of the performer,
 * the target and the privilege, so the trail stays truthful after roles are
 * later renamed or users removed. Since V94 nothing here is a foreign key.
 *
 * <p>The target snapshot is resolved from the identity directory rather than
 * taken from the request. An audit row must not take the identity of the person
 * it names from the caller who named them; the GUID is authoritative either way,
 * but the name beside it is what a reader trusts.
