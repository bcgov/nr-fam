/**
 * Puts names on the assignment rows CSS could only identify by GUID.
 *
 * <p>CSS returns a username, first name, last name and email for anyone who has
 * signed in - those attributes are populated by the sign-in itself. A user
 * created by a grant has never signed in, so CSS holds nothing but
 * {@code <guid>@azureidir}, and the permissions table would show a raw GUID with
 * empty name and email columns.
 *
 * <p>The directory can answer that, given a GUID. So only the rows CSS could not
 * name are looked up, deduplicated by GUID. That was a handful until bulk upload,
 * which grants dozens of people at once who have never signed in.
 *
 * <p><b>Best effort, deliberately.</b> {@link UserLookupClient} otherwise raises
 * an upstream failure rather than returning an empty result, because its usual
 * caller is an administrator searching for somebody and "nobody matched" is a
 * materially different answer from "the directory is unreachable". Here the
 * opposite holds: the assignments are already known and correct, and a directory
 * outage should cost the display of a few names rather than the whole table. So
 * failures are logged and the row is left as CSS returned it.
