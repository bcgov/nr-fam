/**
 * A Business BCeID administrator may only grant to their own organisation.
 *
 * <p>Restores the guard upstream applied to the assignment endpoint
 * ({@code enforce_bceid_by_same_org_guard}), which was lost when grants moved to
 * CSS. The rule survived in {@link AuthorizationService#enforceSameOrganization}
 * but was left wired only to the BCeID lookup, so an administrator could not
 * <em>find</em> a user at another organisation through FAM while still being able
 * to grant to one by supplying the GUID directly.
 *
 * <p><b>The organisation is read from the directory, never from the request.</b>
 * The caller supplies a GUID and a user type; both are claims about somebody
 * else. Upstream took the same position - it looked each target up before
 * comparing - and it is the only version of this check that means anything,
 * since a caller who could assert their target's organisation could assert
 * their way past the rule.
 *
 * <p>This guard is separate from {@link AuthorizationService} because it needs an
 * upstream call to answer. Everything in that class is decided from the
 * requester's token alone, and that is a property worth keeping.
